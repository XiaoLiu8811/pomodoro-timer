# Pomodoro Timer Project

The Pomodoro Timer is a simple, yet effective time management tool designed to boost productivity by breaking down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short and long breaks. This project is an implementation of the Pomodoro Technique, providing a customizable timer for users to apply the technique to their work or study sessions.

## Features

- **Customizable Work Sessions**: Set the duration of your work sessions to fit your personal productivity rhythm.
- **Short and Long Breaks**: Automatically start a short break after each work session, with the option for a longer break after a set number of sessions.
- **Notifications**: Receive desktop notifications when a session ends or a break is over, so you can stay focused on your task without worrying about time.
- **Statistics**: Track your productivity by viewing the number of completed Pomodoro cycles and total focus time.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Use the timer on any device with a web browser, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
